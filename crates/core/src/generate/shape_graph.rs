//! The shape graph generator: a plan from a fixed catalogue of building outlines and a family file that says which rooms the
//! family has and how they connect. `generate --archetype FAMILY --seed N --rooms R` lays the rooms out along a spine inside one of
//! nine outlines, scaled to hold them, mirrored and turned by the seed. Its code holds no room kind of any family: the kinds, the
//! counts, the sizes and the links come from `data/shape-families/<family>.json`. Detail: `docs/areas/graph-generator.md`.
