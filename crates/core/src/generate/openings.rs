//! The symbols a building's doors and windows are drawn with. A seeded profile says which door and window symbols a building
//! uses (a double main entry or a single one, a back door or a service exit, storefront or ribbon or slot windows), and each
//! opening takes a symbol by the profile and the room it is in. The symbol fixes what BIMCraft's `type` command is given (a
//! width, a height, a sill and how the leaves operate), so the script draws it, and the graphs export it as a label.
//!
//! Everything is a function of the seed and the plan, in whole millimetres, so the same brief gives the same openings.
