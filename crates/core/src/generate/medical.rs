//! A medical day department by the pattern of `specs/medical-day-pattern-generator.md`, graph first like the office pattern: a window
//! band of treatment bays open to a patient corridor, core blocks (a treatment block and an isolation block always, a service block
//! on some seeds) between cross corridors, an office band on some seeds, and a staff corridor, with an end corridor at the far end
//! and, at the start, nothing, a head row or a second end corridor. A department, not a building: there is no door to the outside.
//! Layout only: walls, doors, room separation lines and rooms. Each try is built in a scratch project and read back by the topology
//! extractor, so a plan that is written is one whose extracted graph is the generated one and passes the pack
//! (`data/graph-rules/medical-day.json`). Detail: `docs/areas/graph-generator.md`.
