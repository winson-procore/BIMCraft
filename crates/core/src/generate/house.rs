//! A house, graph first: a graph of rooms and the ways between them is sampled from the house rule pack by the seed, and
//! geometry is then found for it, a shell of bands (rectangles) the rooms are dealt into. Every `door` and `open` edge of the
//! graph must land on a wall long enough for it; a try that fails is skipped for the next in a fixed order, and a graph no try
//! fits is refused. Each try is built in a scratch project and read back by the topology extractor, so a house that is
//! written is one whose extracted graph is the generated one. Detail: `docs/areas/graph-generator.md`.
